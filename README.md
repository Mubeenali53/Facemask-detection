# Facemask-detection
This is a proto-type project which detects the face and face-mask. I have made it as it can be used in the places where wearing a mask is compulsary, like as hospitals and like in the case of COVID-19.
It Uses OpenCv,Tensorflow for face and face-mask detection.Other than this I have used Micro-Controller Arduino uno for controlling servo motor based on the detection of the mask.It also gives the count of the people who have entered in a hall/room.
